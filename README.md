We observed several issues with some of the applications used in hotels. Due to these issues, the hotel's overall effectiveness may suffer, and guests may become dissatisfied. So, the "Hotel Liberty" hotel management system has been developed to remedy the problems with the manual system currently in use. This system provides the essential hotel management functions, including reservation management, restaurant management, customer management, and extra-facility management. Customers should register to the system by providing valid details such as Email address, contact number, address etc. Once a customer creates an account, then the customer is eligible to make a reservation and get other hotel services (mini bar, spa, pool, clubs). The system is hence useful for both customers and the owners to manage the hotel activities very efficiently. For managing purpose, Hotel has a huge admin panel.  Admin panel also generate reports. Moreover, this system is designed to accommodate the specific requirements of the business and conduct operations efficiently and effectively.
