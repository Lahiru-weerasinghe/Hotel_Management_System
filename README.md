# Hotel_Management_System

We observed several issues with some of the applications used in hotels. Due to these issues, the hotel's overall effectiveness may suffer, and guests may become dissatisfied. So, the "Hotel Liberty" hotel management system has been developed to remedy the problems with the manual system currently in use. This system provides the essential hotel management functions, including reservation management, restaurant management, customer management, and extra-facility management. Moreover, this system is designed to accommodate the specific requirements of the business and conduct operations efficiently and effectively.
